Links
======
All links will not be underlined at first but will be coloured to let the user know it's a link. When
the user hovers over the link it will then underline.

Buttons

The buttons will make use of the colours above. They will have a "transparent" background with an outline. 
When they are hovered over, they will fill with another colour. They will be flat and have a clean minimal feel.
